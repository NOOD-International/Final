AI PROMPTS FOR NOOD PROPERTIES WEBSITE FIXES
===============================================

PROMPT 1 - For GitHub Copilot Workspace:
----------------------------------------
I have a Next.js 14 project with App Router that needs these specific fixes:

1. Navigation Menu Issue: The navigation menu is inconsistent across pages. Some pages have hidden nav bars inside the clientele page. I need a unified navigation that works the same on every page.

2. Theme Toggle: The light/dark theme toggle is not working properly. It should persist the theme choice and apply it across all pages.

3. Currency Selector: The ROI calculator has a currency selector but it doesn't actually affect the calculations. The currency changes should update the calculator results.

4. Missing Component Titles: Many components are missing their titles/headings.

5. i18n Issues: The project has next-intl setup but it's causing 500 errors. I need the internationalization to work properly.

Current errors in terminal:
- NextIntlClientProvider is not defined
- Module not found: Can't resolve '@/components/ui/dialog'
- Module not found: Can't resolve '@/components/ui/badge'

Please analyze my codebase and provide working solutions for each issue. Focus on making minimal changes that don't break existing functionality.
